# parameter_estimation_Python
In our project we estimated parameters of the interest rate model using historical data by minimizing the cost function (PSO method). 
We used interest rate with Black-Karasinski model with constant parameters and Euler algorithm to obtain numerical solutions to stochastic differential equations in the project. 
For our estimation we used historical data.
